<button class="accordion">What is the housing issue?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The housing issue in Canada is due to a lack of houses, thus making rent and house prices skyrocket. This is causing tons of people in Canada to move areas woth cheaper housing and are discouraging immigrants from coming to Canada because they can’t afford a house to live in. Houses increased by 46% during Covid-19.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Why does the housing issue happen?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The housing issue happened because of the massive inflation from the imbalance between the lack of houses and the high demand for houses. Furthermore, due to the construction of new houses slowing down, bad use of space for constructing houses, and houses that people don't use anymore, wasting even more space</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What this housing crisis forces people to do:</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The only thing people can do if they don’t have a house is to either take out a mortgage so they could live somewhere while they work to pay it off, rent a house for a lot of money, or stay somewhere else cheaper and wait until they can eventually afford it, which might take decades or even longer. The salaries from jobs aren’t helping either as salaries aren't increasing much the same while houses are skyrocketing.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What we can do to help:</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>To help, you can spread awareness about this issue to the government through a variety of means, such as protests or contacting them, which can help by motivating the construction of houses and lowering people’s tax on houses. The government could also pay banks to lessen the interest rates in loans when people are building houses as it’ll convince more people to build new houses.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is the housing issue going to get better soon?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Currently, it looks like the housing crisis isn’t going to end for the next few years naturally unless something drastic is done such as more houses being built or less people in a short period of time. This'll be be incredibly difficult because around 3.5 million houses need to be built buy 2030 for housing prices to go back down, costing trillions of dollars, which costs more than Canada’s entire GDP, meaning the government probably won’t pay for it. The easier way to resolve this is by either using the housing we already have more efficiently by having multiple families living in each house or reducing the people by regulating people from immigrating to Canada and paying people to move to a different country for 250,000$ instead of making a new house, costing 1,000,000$.</p>
